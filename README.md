# Boost Performance
Track performance of a boost session or clan event as a participant or bystander<br><br>
KPH(kills per hour) - hourly rate of kills<br><br>
KC(kill count) - valid kills seen<br>
*additional value in brackets indicates how many burner kills aren't part of calculation<br><br>
Snipes() - kills gained by accounts not specified as main<br>
*additional values are a fraction(1 in X kills is a snipe) and a percentage<br><br>
EHB(Efficient Hours Bossed) - how efficiently you're killing a boss<br>
*additional value in brackets is the multiplicative rate you are over or under the current hourly EHB<br>
**eg, if rate is 50EHB and you're getting 100/hour, you're getting 2.0x EHB<br><br>
PB(Personal Best) - the fastest session kill<br>

Handles multiple worlds at once and utilizes party to ensure all kills are seen.<br>
Calculates EHB Gained and how much over/under the expected rate the boss is dying at.<br>
Tracks snipe count, and displays the rate in both a fraction and percentage
(3 snipes in 495 kc would be a snipe every 1/165 kc or 0.6% of kills)<br>

All reset-current sessions are also tracked overall to know your average performance throughout multiple combined sessions.<br>

Should you kill multiple different bosses the header will state "Overall Mixed" to prevent confusion on values that won't be possible at a current boss.
